# Abhishek's Journal

## Week 1
### What did I do this week?
* In this week I was figuring out how greenfoot works.
* I tried making a easy game by following the tutorial on youtube shared by Sushmitha.
### What am I planning for the next week?
* I am planning to make a health bar that we can use in the actual game to show the player health at any point. Assuming that we are making a game which requires it.

* I have to figure out how if I should use image for health bar or if there is a way that greenfoot provides to build the HP bar.

## Week 2

### What did I do this week?
* So this week I figured out how to make a HP bar and I was reducing the health every second to check if it is working or not.

* I just had to make a rectangle and reduce the size of it according to the requirements.

### What am I planning for the next week?
* I am planning to start looking for the game that we can implement design patterns in.

### Blockers?
* No blockers this week. I am getting comfortable with the greenfoot.
## Week 3

### what did we do?
* We had discussion this week whether we should go with the spider apocalypse or a nintendo style pokemon game and we seem to be inclined toward the pokemon due to it's uniqueness.

* After discussing if we should make the game from scratch or add design patterns to the already existing game, we decided adding the design patterns to the already existing game since focus of this hackathon seems to be implementing the design patterns rather than making a game. Sai found a working repo which we can use for the project.

### what am I planning to do
* I will go through the repo and find the features which can be better implemented using a design pattern.

* No blockers for now.
## Week 4

### what did we do?
* I started working on the command pattern for the options selection while in the battle world.

* There were some issues since the implementation since it was not possible for the actor class to implement an interface. So I decided to implement an abstract ICommand class and let all the button extend that class as commands.

* This made it easier to implement the command pattern in the selection class.

### what am I planning to do
* I am planning to add an intro song before the presentation from the orginal pokemon cartoon.
